== Brief Biography
A\/Prof Adeel Razi’s research interest is in modelling complex, multi-scale, network dynamics of brain structure and function. He uses these (dynamic causal) models to integrate empirical data from multiple modalities (e.g., functional and diffusion MRI) to investigate basic brain and disease mechanisms. A\/Prof Razi is an Australian Research Council DECRA Fellow at the Monash University where he leads the Computational and Systems Neuroscience Laboratory, at the Turner Institute of Brain and Mental Health, which is also a linked lab of Monash Biomedical Imaging. He is also an Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging of University College London where he also worked from 2012 to 2018. He received the B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering (with a Gold Medal) from the N.E.D. University of Engineering & Technology in Karachi, Pakistan, the M.Sc. degree in Communications Engineering from the University of Technology Aachen (RWTH), Germany, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia in 2012. His industrial stints include employment with Broadcom Corporation as Staff Scientist and internships with Infineon Technologies and Delphi Delco Electronics GmbH, Germany.
