== Lab's Research
~~

Our lab’s research vision is to perform cross-disciplinary research combining engineering, physics, and machine-learning approaches to answer questions that are motivated by and grounded in neurobiology. This will enable us to go beyond the traditional boundaries in order to understand how the brain implements cognition.

Our research program’s priority areas include:

- development of multi-modal (e.g., functional MRI, diffusion MRI, EEG) and multi-scale Bayesian methods to characterise brain network dynamics and how these dynamics reorganise with different brain pathologies;
- development of neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence schemes to understand how brain performs reasoning, learning and planning;
- use of classical psychedelics (e.g. LSD and Psilocybin) in combination with computational modelling to understand neural mechanisms underlying altered states of consciousness.
